# list_A

A way to own your data in the cloud, without thirdparties. This web app tries to be an interface with a database in the shape of relational lists.


Given I already started ListA v8, this is already deprecated. But because it is too barebones atm it is rather pointless to upload it. So it will take some time because I'm distracted with Uni and work right now.
